# Data Directory

This directory is used to store user data in JSON format.

**Note**: The `users.json` file is automatically managed by the application and should not be edited manually.

For security reasons, `users.json` is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.

## Storage Location

In this implementation, user data is stored in the browser's LocalStorage, not in files. This directory is a placeholder for potential future file-based storage implementations.
